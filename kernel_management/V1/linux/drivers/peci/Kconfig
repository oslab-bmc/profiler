	  The Platform Environment Control Interface (PECI) is a one-wire bus
	  interface that provides a communication channel from Intel processors
	  and chipset components to external monitoring or control devices.

	  If you want PECI support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This support is also available as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci-core.

if PECI

config PECI_CHARDEV
	tristate "PECI device interface"
	help
	  Say Y here to use peci-* device files, usually found in the /dev
	  directory on your system. They make it possible to have user-space
	  programs use the PECI bus.

	  This support is also available as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci-dev.
