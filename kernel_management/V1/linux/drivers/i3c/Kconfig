	  I3C is a serial protocol standardized by the MIPI alliance.

	  It's supposed to be backward compatible with I2C while providing
	  support for high speed transfers and native interrupt support
	  without the need for extra pins.

	  The I3C protocol also standardizes the slave device types and is
	  mainly designed to communicate with sensors.

	  If you want I3C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This I3C support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i3c.

	tristate "I3C device interface"
	depends on I3C
	help
	  Say Y here to use i3c-* device files, usually found in the /dev
	  directory on your system.  They make it possible to have user-space
	  programs use the I3C devices.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i3cdev.

	  Note that this application programming interface is EXPERIMENTAL
	  and hence SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE while it stabilizes.
